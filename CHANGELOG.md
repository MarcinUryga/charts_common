# 0.3.0
* Simplified API by removing the requirement for specifying the datum type when creating a chart.
For example, previously to construct a bar chart the syntax was 'new BarChart<MyDatumType>()'.
The syntax is now cleaned up to be 'new BarChart()'. Please refer to the
[online gallery](https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/gallery.html) for the correct syntax.
* Added scatter plot charts
* Added tap to hide for legends
* Added support for rendering area skirts to line charts
* Added support for configurable fill colors to bar charts

# 0.2.0

* Dart2 fixes

# 0.1.0

Initial release.
